Description
Hangman is a classic word guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. This Python Hangman game is a text-based implementation of the game.

Features
Randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words.
Displays a visual representation of the hangman as the player makes incorrect guesses.
Allows the player to guess letters one at a time.
Provides feedback on whether the guessed letter is correct or incorrect.
Tracks and displays previously guessed letters.
Ends the game when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.

How to Play
Run the hangman.py file in your Python environment.
The game will start by displaying a blank word with underscores representing each letter.
Guess letters one at a time by entering them via keyboard input.
If the guessed letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
If the guessed letter is incorrect, a part of the hangman will be drawn.
Keep guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or the hangman is fully drawn.
